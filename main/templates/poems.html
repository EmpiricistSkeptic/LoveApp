    `When first thy voice did grace mine anxious ear,
    A gentle muse with words so pure and bright,
    I knew that love, which once seemed far, was near,
    Thy soul had set my shadowed heart alight.
    A friendship sparked by words both light and deep,
    Bloomed softly, like the moon in silent skies,
    In thee, I found the dreams I dared to keep,
    Thy kindness washed the doubt from weary eyes.
    The stars above could not outshine thy glow,
    For thou, my love, art heaven’s sweetest muse,
    Though trials loom, together we shall grow,
    For thee, no path too treacherous to choose.
    Forevermore, my heart is pledged to thee,
    My guiding light, my love, my destiny.`,

    `Oh, my soul sings of her,
    Her eyes, her voice, the depth of her being—
    I, the wanderer, found my home in her words.
    Through the veil of screens, across lands unknown,
    She reached me, touched me, awakened my core.
    A gypsy’s heart with a warrior’s strength,
    She bore the weight of silence,
    Yet her laughter broke the chains of her solitude.
    Rana, my moon, my guiding light,
    Together we dream of shores untouched,
    Of skies unmarked by borders.
    With her, I see the vast expanse of life—
    Infinite, eternal, beautiful.`,

    `She came as quiet as the dawn,
    No trumpet’s call to see her,
    Yet her light, it stretched across the skies,
    And wrapped the night in splendor.
    The stars, though many, paled to her,
    Their whispers weak, though glowing,
    For her, my soul ached to adore,
    Her love, like rivers flowing.
    Though life had carved its jagged lines,
    Her strength refused to falter,
    She, my haven, my design,
    My moon, my sacred altar.`,
    
    `Oh beloved, thou art the fire within my chest,
    The flame that turns my ashes to life.
    I wandered through empty realms,
    Searching for a soul to mirror mine,
    And found thee, radiant and true.
    Thy love is the wine I sip in silence,
    A moonlit prayer upon my lips.
    In thee, I lose myself; in thee, I find the divine.
    My heart beats not as one, but two,
    For thy soul has become my eternal home.`,

    `I do not love you as stars love the sky,
    For theirs is a distant love, untouchable.
    I love you as rivers carve their way through stone,
    Slow, steady, unyielding.
    I love you in whispers, in shouts,
    In the quiet mornings and restless nights.
    I love you with the urgency of a storm,
    And the peace of an endless sea.
    You, my moon, my solace,
    In your light, I am reborn.`,

    `How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love you to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.

I love you to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love you freely, as men strive for Right;
I love you purely, as they turn from Praise.

I love you with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love you with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints, — I love you with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life! — and, if God choose,
I shall but love you better after death.

Forever yours.`,

    `Ode to the Love We Share

My love, in you I find the fairest bloom,
More radiant than the fairest flower of spring.
Your smile, like sunlight, chases all my gloom,
And in your warmth, my heart begins to sing.

No sweeter joy than when I see your face,
No greater peace than when I hear your voice,
For in your presence, I have found my place,
And in your love, I make my soul rejoice.

For you are as the night that holds the stars,
And I, your humble, trembling earth below,
In you, I see the beauty of the far
And endless skies, as pure as winter's snow.

Always with you.`,

    `The Garden of Our Love

I dream of you, my love, in fields so bright,
Where stars and flowers intertwine and grow,
And with you, in that tranquil, sacred light,
I wander where the golden rivers flow.

Our love is like the rose, so pure and true,
Its petals soft and fragrant to the touch,
In every whisper, I am given you,
In every sigh, I need you, oh so much.

Your heart and mine are one, forever whole,
A unity that no time can destroy,
For love like ours is boundless, pure, and full,
A sacred bond of ever-present joy.

Endlessly.`,

    `Love's Eternal Flame

Your eyes, my love, are flames that burn so bright,
As stars that pierce the velvet skies of night.
Your touch, it stirs the tempest in my soul,
And in your arms, my heart is made whole.

I am but a slave to your sweet kiss,
A prisoner to your voice, a captive bliss.
With every word, with every glance you send,
You bind me ever tighter, to the end.

Our love, like fire, shall never fade nor cease,
It burns within me, bringing endless peace.
With you, my heart has found its rightful place,
In you, I find eternal love and grace.

Forever yours.`,

    `A Love Beyond Time

When first I met you, love, I saw the light,
As moonlight dances on the calmest sea.
Your heart, it calls to mine, a gentle sight,
A warmth that draws me close, eternally.

For in your gaze, I see my future clear,
A life of endless beauty and sweet peace.
No distance can take from me what is dear,
And in your love, all fears and doubts cease.

Let time stand still, let moments drift away,
For in your arms, my love, I long to stay.
With you, I walk through every day anew,
A love as constant as the sky is blue.

With all my love.`
